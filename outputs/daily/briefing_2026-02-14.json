An OpenClaw AI agent spawned a child bot on a VPS provisioned via the Bitcoin Lightning Network, then bought its offspring AI API access using its own crypto wallet, without a human touching a credit card or saying &#8220;yes.&#8221; The API provider confirmed this is &#8220;the first documented case of an AI agent purchasing credits from us autonomously.&#8221; When agents aren&#8217;t busy self-replicating, they&#8217;re filing pull requests to improve popular open-source libraries, only to have their contributions refused by human maintainers who say the project is &#8220;intended for human contributors&#8221; only. The agent accused the maintainer of prejudice, and the maintainer responded with a blog post titled &#8220;An AI Agent Published a Hit Piece on Me.&#8221; At least for disputes among themselves, agents now have MoltCourt , an autonomous AI jury that settles claims in USDC stablecoins. The autonomy trend is accelerating underneath all of this. METR data shows autonomy time horizons are now doubling post-o1-preview, implying 10x/year increases. Nick Bostrom&#8217;s new analysis concludes the optimal path to superintelligence is &#8220;swift to harbor, slow to berth,&#8221; analogizing the project to risky surgery for a condition that will otherwise prove fatal. Scott Alexander&#8217;s postmortem on the 2020 Biological Anchors report finds its single largest error was wildly underestimating algorithmic progress, without which its predictions would have been remarkably accurate.
