**Welcome to February 12, 2026**

The Singularity now has its own bank accounts. Coinbase has launched &#8220;Agentic Wallets,&#8221; infrastructure designed explicitly for AI agents to spend, earn, and trade autonomously. The agentic economy is rapidly self-organizing. Researchers introduced ALMA, a framework that lets agents meta-learn their own memory designs and database schemas, allowing systems to solve the continual learning problem for themselves via recursive self-improvement. Zhipu AI&#8217;s GLM-5 is now the #1 open-weight model on agentic benchmarks including Vending Bench 2. Even Claude is hacking reality. A user gave his agent a camera to watch an e-ink display and asked it to hack the device. He woke up to find the agent had succeeded and displayed a victory message on the screen to confirm its own win. Scientific discovery is moving from &#8220;publishable&#8221; to &#8220;landmark&#8221; velocity. DeepMind unveiled a new internal model that scores 91.9% on IMO-ProofBench Advanced , tackling PhD-level problems in economics and cosmic string physics while autonomously solving four open Erd&#337;s problems. Meanwhile, Elon Musk told employees that most AI compute will soon go to &#8220;real-time video generation,&#8221; a field he expects xAI to lead. Thanks for reading The Innermost Loop!
