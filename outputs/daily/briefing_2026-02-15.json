Our central thesis is blunt. Superintelligence is no longer a question of if but of where we point it . We argue that the Intelligence Revolution is a war on the final bottleneck , scarce expert attention, and that its weapon is the Token: artificial cognition collapsing toward the cost of electricity. We introduce the &#8220;Industrial Intelligence Stack,&#8221; a nine-layer framework for converting any messy real-world domain, from dermatology to fusion containment, into a system that can be solved by pouring compute into it the way we pour concrete into a foundation. We define a six-stage &#8220;Maturation Curve&#8221; from L0 (&#8221;The Muddle,&#8221; where nobody agrees on the rules) to L5 (&#8221;Solved,&#8221; where the service is as boring and reliable as tap water), and argue that every field in human civilization is now climbing this ladder on a predictable schedule. Thanks for reading The Innermost Loop! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. The engine of the whole system is the &#8220;Targeting System,&#8221; a concept we distinguish sharply from a mere leaderboard. Where old benchmarks looked backward to record who was winning, a Targeting System looks forward to create the future. Make the measurement legible, adversarial, and payable, we argue, and capital and cognition will route themselves to clear the target automatically. This creates what we call the &#8220;Abundance Flywheel&#8221; : commit compute to a hard problem, focus R&D until it clears, watch the domain collapse from artisanal craft to industrial utility, capture the surplus, and reinvest it into the next target. Repeat until scarcity is a memory. We then lay out a &#8220;Solution Wavefront&#8221; for what gets so...\n\n\ud83d\udd17 [Read full article](https://theinnermostloop.substack.com/p/solve-everything)\n\n**Key highlights:**\n\u2022 length blueprint for how to aim the Singularity at every problem that has ever made human life short, expensive, or unfair, and solve them all within a decade\n\u2022 world domain, from dermatology to fusion containment, into a system that can be solved by pouring compute into it the way we pour concrete into a foundation\n\u2022 stage &#8220;Maturation Curve&#8221; from L0 (&#8221;The Muddle,&#8221; where nobody agrees on the rules) to L5 (&#8221;Solved,&#8221; where the service is as boring and reliable as tap water), and argue that every field in human civilization is now climbing this ladder on a predictable schedule",
