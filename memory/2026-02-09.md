## Design System Created
- Created `/root/.openclaw/workspace/skills/design-system/` with comprehensive design documentation
- Applied to Family Journal and Meal Train apps with warm gradient backgrounds, Nunito font, 56px touch targets
- Design features: WCAG accessibility, mobile-first responsive, smooth animations (150-250ms)

## Journal App Fixes
- Changed sender name placeholder from "Dad, Mom, Auntie Nan, etc." → "Dad, Mom, Auntie, Nan, etc."

## Banner Image Generation (In Progress)
- User wants to replace "Family Journal" title with "Atlas Family Journal" banner
- Attempted using Gemini API with various models:
  - gemini-1.5-pro: Not found
  - gemini-2.0-flash-exp: Not found
  - gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation: Model exists but generate_content didn't work
  - imagen-4.0-generate-preview: Requires billing
  - gemini-2.5-flash-image: Method signature doesn't match expectations
- API key: AIzaSyBb-XPGzEOqKF70UFRFr2HG2oPTVCFva50

## Pending
- Need to successfully generate Atlas Family Journal banner image
- Add banner to Family Journal app header
