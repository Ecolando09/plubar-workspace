## 2026-02-08 - Literacy Quest Development

### Pivoted from Jade Reads to Literacy Quest
- Jade is 6 years old (not 3!), so we upgraded from simple word practice to a full RPG
- Created "Literacy Quest" - an RPG reading adventure where kids battle monsters by answering reading questions

### Literacy Quest Features Built
- **Character Classes:**
  - The Librarian (📚) - Shield ability, blue theme
  - The Poet (✍️) - Double XP on perfect answers, pink theme
  - The Chronicler (📜) - Heal with streaks, green theme

- **Battle System:**
  - Monsters: Word Eater (👾), Grammar Goblin (👺)
  - Multiple choice reading questions deal damage
  - Streak system for bonus XP
  - HP system for player

- **Reading Questions (age-appropriate for 6yo):**
  - Level 1: Rhyming, letter sounds, opposites, basic nouns
  - Level 2: Verbs, compound words, past tense, pronouns
  - Level 3: Main idea, prefixes, inference, similes

- **RPG Systems:**
  - XP and leveling
  - Gold currency
  - Shop with potions, shields, scrolls
  - Inventory system
  - Stats tracking (monsters defeated, correct answers, best streak)

### Technical Setup
- App runs on port 5003
- Cloudflare tunnel: https://respected-funky-phys-casinos.trycloudflare.com
- Nginx config ready for jade-reads.gennetten.org (waiting on DNS)

### Future Enhancements
