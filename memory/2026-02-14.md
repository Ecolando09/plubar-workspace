### Family Journal Voice Recording Fix

**Issues Fixed:**
1. Voice recordings weren't being transcribed - the frontend `transcribeVoiceRecording()` function wasn't being called properly
2. Voice memo files weren't being attached to emails

**What Was Done:**
- Added `transcribeVoiceRecording()` function that sends audio to ElevenLabs API and inserts transcript into story field
- Added voice file handling in `app.py` to save and attach recordings to emails
- Added console logging to frontend for debugging transcription issues
- Added CORS headers to `/transcribe` endpoint
- App restarted successfully on port 5001

**Code Changes:**
- `/root/.openclaw/workspace/family-journal/templates/index.html` - Added transcription logic and logging
- `/root/.openclaw/workspace/family-journal/app.py` - Added voice file attachment handling

**Troubleshooting Note:**
- Had to kill stuck process on port 5001 (PID 654172) to restart the app
- Users should hard refresh (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R) to get updated JavaScript
